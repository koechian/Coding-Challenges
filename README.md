# Code Challenges

- This is a repo of my various code challanges.

## IBM Sample Questions

1. Question one invloved splitting an array into 2 subarrays under certain conditions:

   - The intersection of A and B is Null - the elements found in A must not be found in B
   - The Union of A and B is == the original array.
   - The number of elements in A is minimal

   - I was unable to bring down the runtime to less than 10 sec for larger arrays

2. Question involved linked list traversal, I was supposed to get the data in the nodes, collate them and translate them from binary to decimal. <br> <details closed>
